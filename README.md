wilio SMS Bulk Sender
This project provides a Python script to send bulk SMS messages using the Twilio API. The script reads a list of phone numbers and messages from a JSON file and sends each message individually.

Features
Twilio Integration: Sends SMS messages via Twilio's REST API.
Bulk SMS: Reads multiple phone numbers and messages from a JSON file.
Logging: Displays status messages for each SMS sent, including errors.
Rate Limiting: Adds a delay between messages to avoid exceeding API limits.
